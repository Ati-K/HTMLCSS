          The domestic cat[1][2] (Felis catus[2] or Felis silvestris catus[4],
          informally Felis domesticus[6][7]) is a small, usually furry,
          domesticated, carnivorous mammal. It is often called the housecat when
          kept as an indoor pet,[8] or simply the cat when there is no need to
          distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats are valued by
          humans for companionship and ability to hunt vermin and household
          pests. They are primarily nocturnal.[9] Cats are similar in anatomy to
          the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp
          retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. As
          crepuscular predators, cats use their acute hearing and ability to see
          in near darkness to locate prey. Not only can cats hear sounds too
          faint for human ears, they can also hear sounds higher in frequency
          than humans can perceive. This is because the usual prey of cats
          (particularly rodents such as mice) make high frequency noises, so the
          hearing of the cat has evolved to pinpoint these faint high-pitched
          sounds. Cats also have a much better sense of smell than humans.
          Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat
          communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (meowing,
          purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting) as well as
          pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.[10]
